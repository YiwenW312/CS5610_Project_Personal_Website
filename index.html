        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">Hi, I'm Yiwen Wang, a Computer Science major at Northeastern University. I am passionate about technology and its potential to transform the world. I am seeking an internship in 2024 to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting. I am eager to learn and grow in the tech industry, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a dynamic team.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As a Computer Science major at Northeastern University, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and interdisciplinary experience, including insights from my law Ph.D. My dedication to the tech world is demonstrated by a solid academic record, highlighted by a 4.0 GPA.</li>
          <li>At Northeastern, I founded and led Tech@Crossroads, a student organization aimed at bridging technology with diverse academic disciplines. As the founder and president of Tech@Crossroads, I led the meetings and initiated the project for our own online publishing platform; I gathered and recruited students like me, who are curious about the intersections between tech and other disciplines and willing to polish their skills by developing and maintaining our platform.</li>
          <li>My coursework in Computer Science covers a broad range of industry-relevant topics, including Java, Object-Oriented Design, Data Structures, and Web Development. I've gained hands-on experience through project-based courses, honing my skills in software engineering and database management, for example, going through all stages of the development cycle, using GitHub for teamwork, and deploying the course project to the public.</li>
          <li>Participating in hackathons has been a valuable avenue for me to adapt to new challenges quickly, learn new skills quickly, and collaborate effectively with diverse teams. I thrive in team settings, ensuring organization and fostering a positive, confident atmosphere. I will help the team be organized and planned, make sure everyone feels confident and comfortable with their work, and also connect them together. I also took the most challenging jobs that the team members were afraid of, even though I was also new to some jobs.</li>
          <li>I approach my professional and personal life with preparedness, optimism, and relentless curiosity. These traits not only make me resilient but also fuel my passion for continuous learning and growth in the field of technology.</li>
      </ul>
