        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            I grew up in Shanghai, China, and moved to Seattle, WA, to pursue a Ph.D. in Law at the University of Washington. During my years of legal studies, I rediscovered my interest in computers and envisioned the integration of technology into the legal field. This passion led me to the Computer Science Master's program at Northeastern University's Seattle campus.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            Beyond my coursework, I founded Tech@Crossroads, a student organization dedicated to encouraging interdisciplinary exploration. This initiative not only merges my legal background with technology but also invites students from diverse fields to collaborate and share their expertise. Together, we work on projects that bridge the information gap between tech and non-tech students, fostering a community of innovation and shared learning.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            As a problem solver, quick learner, and team player, I am eager to find a Software Engineer position where I can continue to grow and make an impact.
